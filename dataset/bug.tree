{all:{asin:0004126815}{description:It had to happen: a Christmas dinner without goose, turkey, ham, or other traditional entr{&#x82;}ees. English vegetarian chef Elliot prepares six holiday menus, complete with timetables and good color                   photographs, all without meat. In a rather disjointed fashion, she opens with desserts (Englands traditional Christmas cake, a variation of fruitcake) and other recipes to be made in advance and frozen. Before long, holiday meals, lunches, suppers,       and snacks appear, all an odd mixture of sophisticated and simple dishes, from fennel parmesan and oyster mushroom risotto to Father Christmas faces, many of which, unfortunately, contain quite a few ingredients (e.g., mangetouts, marmite) that           should have been translated for American cooks. Sweets consume three chapters; in total, the more than 150 recipes provide an unusual way to summon in the holidays.Barbara Jacobs}{title:Rose Elliots Vegetarian Christmas: Over 150 Recipes for the          Festive Season}{imUrl:http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31tvHo7GUUL.jpg}{salesRank:{Books:2296126}}{categories:{item:{item:Books}}}}
